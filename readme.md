# Kevin Liao GoFetch Application

This is readme of GoFetch Application for Spider Tracks .

I am running on both Windows 7 and Mac OS X. They works for both.

## Running the application demo

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you to run the demo.

```terminal
git clone git@https://github.com/kevin-liao/gofetch.git ~/.gofetch
cd ~/.gofetch
mvn exec:java
```

## Principles

### Use existing framework as much as possible

- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for zsh configuration
- [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) for vim configuration

### KISS - Keep it simple and stupid
    
- Keep it simple. You probably can remove most of configuration files after you fork this repo, then add your configuration files!
- No magic.
